# Birthday-Wisher

You must have a .env file for sender's mail and password or write your information inside main.py

For people's birthday and mail information use birthdays.csv file ( You can write information yourself )

I used PythonAnywhere for running my code in cloud daily, but if you are going to use this you should change file paths to full paths
  example for PythonAnywhere : use "/home/yourusername/project-folder/birthdays.csv" instead of just "birthdays.csv"
